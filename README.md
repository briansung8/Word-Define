A dictionary app that queries a word's definition based on input. 
<br>
Calls a search term and sends a URL request to the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev) to generate an output.

# Technologies used
The backend uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) to setup a HTTP server that queries the REST API.
<br>
The frontend uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework. Also, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used for the data layer.
# Acknowledgments
I received guidance on implementing REST API calls through the tutorial ["How to Use RESTful APIs with Django"](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/02/03/how-to-use-restful-apis-with-django.html) by Vitor Freitas.
